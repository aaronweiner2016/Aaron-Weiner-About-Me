# Aaron-Weiner-About-Me

#About this Project:
  
  -My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio so that in the future employers can look at a page about myself and the projects i have created and try and form an image of who i am! This project helps most towards perfecting my coding skills and giving me a platform in which i can show what i can do. 
  
#Looking at the Page:
 
  -The header contains my name and a navigation bar taking you to other sections of the page
  -Below the header is a picture of myself
  -Following that is 3 sections in which represent some information about myself, some projects in which i have created, and some information so that anyone may contact me
